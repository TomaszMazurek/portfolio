This encounter changed me forever. I still remember my parents whining about me, spending hours experimenting with it, every time we paid him a visit. It was early 80\u2019s. I spent my all my pocket money on computer magazines. For months i tortured my parents to get me microcomputer. In 1985, on my 10th birthday, I got my first machine. It was 8 bit Atari 65XE. There were 3 ways in which user could input program into this machine. First, fastest, most reliable and most trivial way was, to put plastic cardridge with program data, into a special "hole" in computer\u2019s plastic case. Program was loaded almost instantly. Second method, less trivial, not so fast and surely not so reliable was to load program from compact cassette tapes. Such cassette was holding magnetic tape enclosed in plastic case. Program has been written in form of digital signal encoded on two sides of the tape. It was really tricky to load it, though. Tape was long and very fragile. Loading could take up to 45 min per side and could be easily disturbed, for many reasons. Deformed tape, DAC head faulty setup, even loud noise could make loading to fail at some point. Last, most time consuming, least reliable and most complicated was to enter program by hand. With keyboard. This was what i prefered. Computer magazines at that time were filled with listing of programs. It could be anyting: Pascal, Basic, C, assembly and even machine code. Not only for Atari but for every 8 bit machine on the market. I learned a lot from typing and debugging code entered this way. Every successful launch was like getting onto the top of the mountain but costed hours of debugging. Strange hobby for 10-year-old boy, i know. After some time I decided to write my own programs. First language I was using was Atari Logo. The point of the matter was to move virtual turtle on the screen with code. It was like programming robots. After some experimenting i got bored and switched to Atari Basic. It was procedural language, quite easy to grasp. Problem with this language laid in conditional jumps. It was similar to assembly language subroutines, except it took line number instead of name to invoke. Because of this, programs written in Basic had tendency to transform into spagetti real quick. It was nearly impossible to write bigger programs with such language. After some time I moved to Pascal. It was my first mature language. I spent many hours trying to learn it but because small number of listings published in magazines it was really hard to figure out. Books i couldn\'t afford and there was no www at that time. At the same time I tried to get a grasp on C but it was affected by the same problems as Pascal.',o.a.createElement(oe,null,"16 bit"),"After few years, as a seasoned 8bit-user I got my first 16bit experience. It was a game Space Ace on Amiga. Impression was jaw-dropping. I started to torture my parents right away. After year or so i got Amiga 500. It was absolutely stunnig piece of hardware capable of things I couldn\u2019t even imagine as a Atari user, yet my experience with it was different. Even though typing code from listings and experimenting with my own code was educative, I turned to something else. It was Soundtracker and was like writing music with machine code. Soon I got my first sampler and started to create music using my own samples. Several months after i joined non formal group of people which called themselves Amiga Demo Scene. It was a group of Amiga microcomputer enthusiasts which was trying to push the boundried of what\u2019s possible on this machne by making multimedia programs named \u201cdemos\u201d. My first group was \u201cKatharsis\u201d. We were 5 people and everyone of us in group had some role. There was coder, graphics artist, music artist and swapper who\u2019s role was to distribute our demos. Apart form making music, I was experimenting with Amiga assemby language and 3D graphics. I was 14 and I found my place in life. I was happy.",o.a.createElement(oe,null,"Disaster"),"I grew up in small town in Silesian District which is industrial heart of Poland. We\u2019ve got 7 coal mines, dirty air and moon landscape. My father was fixing cars and running small bussiness. At the late 80\u2019s he left Poland and moved to New York where he was working for 2 years to earn money to move his bussines to new location. I was almost 15 at that time, graduating from elementary school. I knew that I want to be a programmer and work with computers. My plan was to get into secondary vocational school with profile in informatics. Next move would be to enroll in the University of Technology where I could learn computer science. Unfortunatelly, my father had other plans for me and my future. He wanted me to get involved in bussines he was running, help him build new building for this bussiness and take it over after he will retire. My mother supporting me, but after being blackmailed by my father, she gave up. It was huge blow for me but I had no other choice than yield to my father's will. He sent me to basic vocational school with car repair specialization which i hated. For two more years I was trying to be active on Amiga Demo Scene but it was becoming more difficult every month. I was attending school for 2-3 days a week and work for the rest of the week. I was working with my father in his garage for 8h-10h per day. On my school break i had to work full-time. Including Saturdays. At the age of 15. For free. Moreover, my father figured out that my passion for computers is harmful for productivity and decided to destroy it. He was filling my spare time with various tasks at home or garden. When i asked him why he was doing it to me, he was explaining: \u201cComputers has no future, son. You must think realistically\u201d. Oh sweet irony. He couldn't be further from the truth. I could only use my Amiga late at night and on holidays. Because of that i couldn't deliver on time tasks i was assigned to. My ties with friends from Amiga Demo Scene and my group were growing thin. After 2 years or so, i lost contact with my friends and have been cut off from all their projects. I felt like I was slowly slippling into depression. But i was still dreaming that someday i will be professional programmer.",o.a.createElement(oe,null,"Struggle"),"I\u2019ve finished basic vocational school and decided to go to vocational secondary school. I wanted to keep up to my original plan even thought it has been modified by my father. I wanted to get into college to study Computer Science, even if it would take longer than i expected. My father was not happy. After several fights, blackmails and other usual stuff, he yielded. Not entirely thought. He forced me to choose shool of specific with automotive profile. I decided to bite the bullet. I had no computer because i had no money. I had no money because i wasn't paid for my work. My only option to get into programming was to learn it in college. And it was still possible. My weekday was starting at 6:00 am. After work, at 2 pm I was driving to school, located 25 km away from where I lived. I was sitting in school until about 8 pm. From 9 pm to midnight i was doing my assignments. It took me 3 years to finish this school. I considered it my my success but circumstances were far from what I\u2019ve expected. It was 1996, dot-com bubble was growing really fast and demand for programmers was huge. And i still didn't have my own computer. I\u2019ve done some research. Public colleges with computer science profile were overcrowded. Competition was such that all i have achieved wasn\u2019t even remotely close to what was required. And 15 students was competing for one place. Turned out that all of my effort was for nothing. I was crushed and overwhelmed by this failure. I have failed to pass final exams, since it wasn\u2019t make any sense to me. Another blow. I slept into depression even further. After few months, once again I decided to suck it up. I passed exams and graduated from secondary vocational school. My ambition shrinked and all I wanted was to escape from my father. I gathered myself up and started my way out.

It is hard to explain but instead of studying journalism i was studying economy even though officially i wasn not. Every semester i\u2019ve been told that journalism as a subject will be available next semester. It has to gather enough students to be cost-effective. I started slipping back into depression at higher speed than ever before. At 4th semester my parents got divorced, funds dried up and i\u2019ve got into depression so far I had to get back home to start some treatment because i was falling into pieces.I got back to work with my father.

After 20 years I attending school i was dreaming of. That was really weird experience. I found my first IT job in local firm which was servicing IT infrastructure in local coal mines. It was simple IT suport job. I got plenty of free time to learn. Thanks to this job I was able to make up for the lost time.
