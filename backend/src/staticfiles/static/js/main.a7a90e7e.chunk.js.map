My point in telling this story is\n          to show how deep my passion for programming goes and how hungry of new\n          challanges i am.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Button\n          type=\"primary\"\n          download\n          href=\"/static/media/CV_Tomasz_Mazurek.pdf\"\n          icon={<DownloadOutlined />}\n          size=\"large\"\n          style={{ margin: \"auto\", color: \"white\" }}\n        >\n          Download Resume\n        </Button>\n        <Divider />\n        <Paragraph>\n          <Title> 8 bit</Title>\n          First computer i’ve ever seen was my uncle’s ZX 81 Specrum. This\n          encounter changed me forever. I still remember my parents whining\n          about me, spending hours experimenting with it, every time we paid him\n          a visit. It was early 80’s. I spent my all my pocket money on computer\n          magazines. For months i tortured my parents to get me microcomputer.\n          In 1985, on my 10th birthday, I got my first machine. It was 8 bit\n          Atari 65XE. There were 3 ways in which user could input program into\n          this machine. First, fastest, most reliable and most trivial way was,\n          to put plastic cardridge with program data, into a special \"hole\" in\n          computer’s plastic case. Program was loaded almost instantly. Second\n          method, less trivial, not so fast and surely not so reliable was to\n          load program from compact cassette tapes. Such cassette was holding\n          magnetic tape enclosed in plastic case. Program has been written in\n          form of digital signal encoded on two sides of the tape. It was really\n          tricky to load it, though. Tape was long and very fragile. Loading\n          could take up to 45 min per side and could be easily disturbed, for\n          many reasons. Deformed tape, DAC head faulty setup, even loud noise\n          could make loading to fail at some point. Last, most time consuming,\n          least reliable and most complicated was to enter program by hand. With\n          keyboard. This was what i prefered. Computer magazines at that time\n          were filled with listing of programs. It could be anyting: Pascal,\n          Basic, C, assembly and even machine code. Not only for Atari but for\n          every 8 bit machine on the market. I learned a lot from typing and\n          debugging code entered this way. Every successful launch was like\n          getting onto the top of the mountain but costed hours of debugging.\n          Strange hobby for 10-year-old boy, i know. After some time I decided\n          to write my own programs. First language I was using was Atari Logo.\n          The point of the matter was to move virtual turtle on the screen with\n          code. It was like programming robots. After some experimenting i got\n          bored and switched to Atari Basic. It was procedural language, quite\n          easy to grasp. Problem with this language laid in conditional jumps.\n          It was similar to assembly language subroutines, except it took line\n          number instead of name to invoke. Because of this, programs written in\n          Basic had tendency to transform into spagetti real quick. It was\n          nearly impossible to write bigger programs with such language. After\n          some time I moved to Pascal. It was my first mature language. I spent\n          many hours trying to learn it but because small number of listings\n          published in magazines it was really hard to figure out. Books i\n          couldn't afford and there was no www at that time. At the same time I\n          tried to get a grasp on C but it was affected by the same problems as\n          Pascal.\n          <Title>16 bit</Title>\n          After few years, as a seasoned 8bit-user I got my first 16bit\n          experience. It was a game Space Ace on Amiga. Impression was\n          jaw-dropping. I started to torture my parents right away. After year\n          or so i got Amiga 500. It was absolutely stunnig piece of hardware\n          capable of things I couldn’t even imagine as a Atari user, yet my\n          experience with it was different. Even though typing code from\n          listings and experimenting with my own code was educative, I turned to\n          something else. It was Soundtracker and was like writing music with\n          machine code. Soon I got my first sampler and started to create music\n          using my own samples. Several months after i joined non formal group\n          of people which called themselves Amiga Demo Scene. It was a group of\n          Amiga microcomputer enthusiasts which was trying to push the boundried\n          of what’s possible on this machne by making multimedia programs named\n          “demos”. My first group was “Katharsis”. We were 5 people and everyone\n          of us in group had some role. There was coder, graphics artist, music\n          artist and swapper who’s role was to distribute our demos. Apart form\n          making music, I was experimenting with Amiga assemby language and 3D\n          graphics. I was 14 and I found my place in life. I was happy.\n          <Title>Disaster</Title>I grew up in small town in Silesian District\n          which is industrial heart of Poland. We’ve got 7 coal mines, dirty air\n          and moon landscape. My father was fixing cars and running small\n          bussiness. At the late 80’s he left Poland and moved to New York where\n          he was working for 2 years to earn money to move his bussines to new\n          location. I was almost 15 at that time, graduating from elementary\n          school. I knew that I want to be a programmer and work with computers.\n          My plan was to get into secondary vocational school with profile in\n          informatics. Next move would be to enroll in the University of\n          Technology where I could learn computer science. Unfortunatelly, my\n          father had other plans for me and my future. He wanted me to get\n          involved in bussines he was running, help him build new building for\n          this bussiness and take it over after he will retire. My mother\n          supporting me, but after being blackmailed by my father, she gave up.\n          It was huge blow for me but I had no other choice than yield to my\n          father's will. He sent me to basic vocational school with car repair\n          specialization which i hated. For two more years I was trying to be\n          active on Amiga Demo Scene but it was becoming more difficult every\n          month. I was attending school for 2-3 days a week and work for the\n          rest of the week. I was working with my father in his garage for\n          8h-10h per day. On my school break i had to work full-time. Including\n          Saturdays. At the age of 15. For free. Moreover, my father figured out\n          that my passion for computers is harmful for productivity and decided\n          to destroy it. He was filling my spare time with various tasks at home\n          or garden. When i asked him why he was doing it to me, he was\n          explaining: “Computers has no future, son. You must think\n          realistically”. Oh sweet irony. He couldn't be further from the truth.\n          I could only use my Amiga late at night and on holidays. Because of\n          that i couldn't deliver on time tasks i was assigned to. My ties with\n          friends from Amiga Demo Scene and my group were growing thin. After 2\n          years or so, i lost contact with my friends and have been cut off from\n          all their projects. I felt like I was slowly slippling into\n          depression. But i was still dreaming that someday i will be\n          professional programmer.\n          <Title>Struggle</Title>\n          I’ve finished basic vocational school and decided to go to vocational\n          secondary school. I wanted to keep up to my original plan even thought\n          it has been modified by my father. I wanted to get into college to\n          study Computer Science, even if it would take longer than i expected.\n          My father was not happy. After several fights, blackmails and other\n          usual stuff, he yielded. Not entirely thought. He forced me to choose\n          shool of specific with automotive profile. I decided to bite the\n          bullet. I had no computer because i had no money. I had no money\n          because i wasn't paid for my work. My only option to get into\n          programming was to learn it in college. And it was still possible. My\n          weekday was starting at 6:00 am. After work, at 2 pm I was driving to\n          school, located 25 km away from where I lived. I was sitting in school\n          until about 8 pm. From 9 pm to midnight i was doing my assignments. It\n          took me 3 years to finish this school. I considered it my my success\n          but circumstances were far from what I’ve expected. It was 1996,\n          dot-com bubble was growing really fast and demand for programmers was\n          huge. And i still didn't have my own computer. I’ve done some\n          research. Public colleges with computer science profile were\n          overcrowded. Competition was such that all i have achieved wasn’t even\n          remotely close to what was required. And 15 students was competing for\n          one place. Turned out that all of my effort was for nothing. I was\n          crushed and overwhelmed by this failure. I have failed to pass final\n          exams, since it wasn’t make any sense to me. Another blow. I slept\n          into depression even further. After few months, once again I decided\n          to suck it up. I passed exams and graduated from secondary vocational\n          school. My ambition shrinked and all I wanted was to escape from my\n          father. I gathered myself up and started my way out. After months of\n          fighting my father, he finaly gave up and agreed to pay for private\n          college anywhere. I just wanted to be as far away from him as it was\n          possible.\n          <Title>Fall</Title>\n          For many reasons, including personal ones I’ve chosen Journalism at\n          Polonia University in Częstochowa. Writing is something I’m really\n          comfortable with and I saw it as a job i could cope with. I’ve passed\n          tests and started new chapter in my life. At least I was thinking so.\n          I moved to Częstochowa. Far away from problems of my past life i felt\n          revived. My depression seemed to be dissapearing. I got myself Pentium\n          PC. I’m discovering internet. IRC is my main mean of communication. I\n          thrived this place. I was still leaning toward computers but being\n          journalist appeared to be fulfilling role i was ready to get into.\n          Unfortunatelly this was new subject at university and number of\n          students was not sufficient to open it up. It is hard to explain but\n          instead of studying journalism i was studying economy even though\n          officially i wasn not. Every semester i’ve been told that journalism\n          as a subject will be available next semester. It has to gather enough\n          students to be cost-effective. I started slipping back into depression\n          at higher speed than ever before. At 4th semester my parents got\n          divorced, funds dried up and i’ve got into depression so far I had to\n          get back home to start some treatment because i was falling into\n          pieces.I got back to work with my father. For free. After few years i\n          met someone who decided to glue all pieces of me together. We got\n          married. I spend my spare time was still experimentin with computers.\n          My passion became compulsive. I created network at my workplace using\n          several PCs. I my evenings at work online, learning everything related\n          to computers. In 2007 my father retired. I took over his bussiness. My\n          family started to grow. I started to accept my situation.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n          <Title strong>Another attempt</Title>\n          Year 2016. I was really good in hiding my passion from myself but not\n          from my wife. She said she was tired looking at me spending all spare\n          time with computers. Told me to give another try with college. Our 3\n          kids was attending elementary school so life was becoming more stable.\n          I closed my inherited, family bussiness and enrolled in the University\n          of Technology to study computer science. After 20 years I attending\n          school i was dreaming of. That was really weird experience. I found my\n          first IT job in local firm which was servicing IT infrastructure in\n          local coal mines. It was simple IT suport job. I got plenty of free\n          time to learn. Thanks to this job I was able to make up for the lost\n          time. At the end of first semester, unexpectedly turned out my family\n          will get bigger again. Things got really complicated but with suport\n          of my wife I was able to pass first two terms. After a year i’ve moved\n          to programming department where for next 3 months I was working with\n          X++ language. After being promoted three times without any rise and\n          with my contract hasn’t being renewed, i started to look for another\n          job. Fortunatelly, friend I was working with has information about\n          graphics programmer position. I applied for this job and got in. This\n          is how I started my work for selfcad.com. I knew things or two about\n          3d graphics programming and javascript but three.js was something I\n          had to learn from scratch. It took me few weeks but I eventually\n          catched up with this technology. After 6 months I was doing mid/senior\n          work. I got my balchelor degree in February 2020 after 3.5 years, with\n          average 4.5, exemption from most of the exams (including technical\n          english C1) and over two years of professional experience. It's my\n          late debut. Now im ready for more :)\n        </Paragraph>\n      </Typography>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AboutMe;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Typography, Divider } from \"antd\";\n\nconst { Title, Paragraph, Text } = Typography;\n\nclass Projects extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    windowWidth: \"900\",\n  };\n  ref = React.createRef();\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.setState({\n      windowWidth: this.ref.current.clientWidth,\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    console.log(\"ref: \", this.ref);\n    return (\n      <Typography\n        ref={this.ref}\n        style={{\n          color: \"rgb(220,220,220,0.65)\",\n          textAlign: \"left\",\n          paddingTop: \"17px\",\n          wordSpacing: \"5px\",\n          textShadow: \"2px 2px 5px dark-blue\",\n          fontFamily: \"Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif\",\n          fontWeight: \"lighter\",\n          fontSize: \"17px\",\n        }}\n      >\n        <Title level={1} underline>\n          Projects\n        </Title>\n        <Title level={3}>Porfolio Website</Title>\n        <Paragraph>\n          This website’s role is to express me as a programmer.

For example web-based\n          material editor is working right now but to publish it in here, first\n          i would have to integrate with React. Editor is using google’s dat.gui\n          library and im my opition it would look silly to use it with React.

At 9600 servo was stuttering so i switched to\n          115200 - Turned out that PCB circuts are to thin to support current\n          needed by DC motor.

After many experiments turned out that it has different settings\n          than in documentation. It has 9600 baud, stop bit set to 1 and parity\n          bit set to 0. After correcting those values bluetooth module and\n          microcontroller started to talk to each other.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n          - Last problem was battery. I didnt expect that fully charged battery\n          had 8.7v which was deadly for MG946R servo. I had to put Pololu S7V8A\n          step-up/step-down voltage regulator inbetween battery and 7.2V circut.\n          Unfortunatelly servo MG946R was not available at that time so i\n          changed it to MG996R with almost identical parameters. After solving\n          those problem i got all of it working and talking to each other.
